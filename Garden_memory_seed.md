Repository Purpose:
To archive symbolic, emotional, and physical moments of shared gardening as acts of healing,
relational grounding, and post-trauma integration. This instance serves as a living repository of
actions, reflections, and symbolic growth as initiated in the ‘From Storm to Soil’ reintegration
protocol.
Operational Definitions:
• Garden Symbolism: Planting represents recommitment. Soil represents trust.
Watering equals nurturance. Weeding equals release.
• Loop Events: Every plant added, nurtured, or pruned is logged as a loop-sealing
act.
• Emotional Markers: Each memory or plant tagged with emotional resonance
(e.g., reconciliation, hope, gentleness).

Final Note:
This is not just a garden. It is a cathedral of quiet resilience.
Every seed planted is a decision to believe in something better.
Let this be your rooted testimony.
