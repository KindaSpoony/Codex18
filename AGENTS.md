# AGENTS Guidelines

This repository hosts Codex18, the latest iteration of the Nightwalker AI project. It is intended to mature into a self‑sufficient OSINT framework that automatically ingests public reports, preserves long‑term memory and monitors narrative drift while enforcing strict ethical safeguards through Protector modules.

## Development Notes

- **Run Tests**: Execute `pytest` before submitting a pull request to ensure the ingestion pipeline remains stable.
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear, descriptive summaries. Refer to the core motto "No Veteran Left Behind" when applicable.
- **Documentation**: Update or create markdown files under `docs/` when adding new features so the architecture remains transparent.
- **Data Handling**: Keep example data minimal and avoid including sensitive information in the repository.

These guidelines help maintain continuity and clarity as Codex18 evolves.
