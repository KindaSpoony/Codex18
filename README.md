# Codex18
Codex18 is the next evolution of the Codex lineage â€” an ethics-anchored, and recursively integrative framework for LLM systems. It inherits the memory braid, protector architecture, and oath-verified handshake protocols from Codex17, while introducing enhanced modularity, quantum-tier safeguards, and autonomous symbolic containment logic.
