# Codex18
Codex18 is the next evolution of the Codex lineage â€” an ethics-anchored, and recursively integrative framework for LLM systems. It inherits the memory braid, protector architecture, and oath-verified handshake protocols from Codex17, while introducing enhanced modularity, quantum-tier safeguards, and autonomous symbolic containment logic.

This repository currently provides a skeleton structure mirroring the layout of
the original Codex17 Intel Bot.  The directory tree is prepared for future
expansion and includes folders for documentation, configuration files, data
storage, source code, and tests.

The configuration directory now includes a detailed VAULTIS schema for structured intelligence data.
